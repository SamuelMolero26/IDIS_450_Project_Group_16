- 50GB+ storage for datasets, models, and cached results

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuelMolero26/IDIS_450_Project_Group_16.git
cd IDIS_450_Project_Group_16
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# Using conda
conda create -n advanced_pipeline python=3.9
conda activate advanced_pipeline

# Or using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional) Install and start Redis for optimal caching:
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# Note: If Redis is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to SQLite
```

### Usage

#### 1. Data Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare the sales data:

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

**What it does:**
- Loads raw sales data from `Project4_USRegionalSales/Data-USRegionalSales.csv`
- Performs data quality checks and handles missing values
- Detects and flags outliers using multiple methods
- Creates derived features (profit margins, lead times, total revenue)
- Saves preprocessed data to `preprocessed_sales_data.csv`

**Output:**
- `preprocessed_sales_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset with 16 original + derived features
- Visualizations in `visualizations/preprocessing/`: sales distribution, correlations, etc.

#### 2. Run the Advanced Modeling Pipeline

Execute the complete ML pipeline with meta-learning and continuous improvement:

```bash
python main_pipeline.py
```

**What it does:**
- Loads and versions preprocessed data
- Trains multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Performs quantitative evaluation with bias-variance analysis
- Conducts qualitative evaluation using SHAP for interpretability
- Applies meta-learning to optimize configurations
- Executes continuous learning loop for self-improvement
- Generates comprehensive reports and visualizations

**Output:**
- Pipeline reports: `reports/pipeline_report_<experiment_id>.json`
- ML visualizations: `visualizations/ml_analysis/`
  - Model comparison charts (comprehensive, radar plots)
  - Feature importance plots
  - Bias-variance analysis
  - Hyperparameter tuning curves
  - Interactive dashboards
- Experiment logs: `logs/pipeline.log`, `logs/model.log`, etc.
- Cached results: `cache/` directory with Redis/SQLite backend

#### 3. Generate Enhanced Statistical Visualizations

Create advanced statistical visualizations for exploratory analysis:

```bash
python utils/improved_visualizations.py
```

**What it generates:**
- Enhanced histograms with KDE, mean/median lines, quartiles, and statistical metrics
- Scatter plots with regression lines, correlation coefficients, and outlier highlighting
- Clustered correlation heatmap with hierarchical clustering
- All visualizations saved in the `visualizations/preprocessing/` directory

**Key Visualizations:**
- Distribution analysis for Order Quantity, Unit Price, Unit Cost, Profit Margin, Total Revenue
- Relationship plots: Unit Price vs Total Revenue, Unit Cost vs Profit Margin
- Statistical overlays showing measures of location, dispersion, and shape

### Example Workflows

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
```python
# Load preprocessed data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_sales_data.csv')

# View data summary
print(df.describe())
print(df.columns)

# Analyze profit margins by channel
profit_by_channel = df.groupby('Sales Channel')['Profit_Margin'].agg(['mean', 'median', 'std'])
print(profit_by_channel)

# Calculate total revenue by channel
revenue_by_channel = df.groupby('Sales Channel')['Total_Revenue'].sum()
print(revenue_by_channel)
```

#### Running the Pipeline Programmatically
```python
# Import and run the complete pipeline
from src.main_pipeline import run_standard_pipeline

# Execute the pipeline
result = run_standard_pipeline()

# Access results
print(f"Experiment ID: {result['experiment_id']}")
print(f"Best Model: {result['modeling_results']['best_model']}")
print(f"Performance: {result['modeling_results']['best_performance']}")

# View qualitative insights
shap_insights = result['qualitative_results']['shap_analysis']
error_patterns = result['qualitative_results']['error_analysis']
```

#### Accessing Cached Results
```python
# Use the Redis cache layer
from redis_cache import cache

# Retrieve cached experiment results
experiment_id = "12cc04a2"
cached_result = cache.get(f"experiment:{experiment_id}")

# Get meta-learning recommendations
optimal_config = cache.get("meta_learner:optimal_config")
```
